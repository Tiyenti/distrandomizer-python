* Changelog
** v0.1.4-alpha
- Seed is now passed in through a command line flag, instead of the interactive
  prompt
- There's also now flags for verbosity and no softlock checking, which previously
  could only be enabled by editing the script.
** v0.1.3-alpha
- Random seeds are now recoverable - they are printed in the script output
  and in the generated playlist file.
** v0.1.2-alpha
- Destination Unknown and Credits are now included in the playlist
  (you do not need the .bytes, though - they are always added at the end
  unmodified)
** v0.1.1-alpha
- Fixed generated levels having ID conflicts that would prevent them 
  from loading.
- Added a --verison flag.
** v0.1-alpha
- Initial release
